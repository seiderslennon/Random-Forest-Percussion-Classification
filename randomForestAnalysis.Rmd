### graph is pretty self explanatory
```{r}
hist(treesize(rf),
     main = "No. of Nodes for the Trees",
     col = "green")
```
### error rate of random forest
```{r}
plot(rf)
```
### mfcc2 is the most important attribute followed by mfcc1
```{r}
varImpPlot(rf, n.var = 7,main = "Variable Importance")
importance(rf)
```
### Partial dependence plot gives a graphical depiction of the marginal effect of a variable on the class probability (classification)
```{r}
partialPlot(rf, train, sfms, "kick")
```
#### if the sfm is less than ~0.3, higher chances of classifying into kick class.


### Plot the scaling coordinates of the proximity matrix from randomForest
```{r}
MDSplot(rf, train$class_list)
```
