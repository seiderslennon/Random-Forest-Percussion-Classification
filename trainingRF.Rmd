### create the random forest using the R randomForest package:
```{r}
rf <- randomForest(class_list~., data=train, proximity=TRUE, ntree=150)
print(rf)

```

### Use newly created random forest to classify its own training data. Resulting accuracy should be 100%
```{r}
p1 <- predict(rf, train)
confusionMatrix(p1, train$ class_list)

```

### classify test data and generate confusion matrix
```{r}
p2 <- predict(rf, test)
confusionMatrix(p2, test$ class_list)
```

### randomForest's tuneRF function to explore different ntree values
```{r}
t <- tuneRF(train[,-4], train[,4],
       stepFactor = 5,
       plot = TRUE,
       ntreeTry = 50,
       trace = TRUE,
       doBest=TRUE,
       improve = 0.01)

p3 <- predict(t, test)
confusionMatrix(p3, test$ class_list)
```

#### played around with this function a little bit, it didn't seem to be very helpful given that the tuning method has no patience for anything besides an decrease in error.
